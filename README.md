# Menu Maker

This project allows restaurant owners to register their restaurant and create a customized menu, allowing customers to easily view the restaurant's offerings from a desktop or mobile device.

Menu Maker is a project that showcases my understanding of best practices using the following technologies:

* Django
* Git

Menu Maker makes use of the following Django features:

- Django ORM (This project uses SQLite for maximum ease of setup)
- Function-Based Views
- Class-Based Views
- Testing using Django's built-in testing tools

This project also represents an effort to implement proper Git best practices, including:

- small, incremental commits
- explain each commit concisely and accurately
