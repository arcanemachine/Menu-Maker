# Menu Maker

Menu Maker is a project that showcases my understanding of best practices using the following technologies:

* Django
* Git

This project allows restaurant owners to register their restaurant and create a customized menu, allowing customers to easily view the restaurant's offerings from a desktop or mobile device.

Menu Maker makes use of the following Django features:

- Class-Based Views
- Testing using the built-in tests (Models and Views)

This project is also an attempt to implement proper Git best practices, including:

- small, incremental commits
- explain each commit concisely and accurately
